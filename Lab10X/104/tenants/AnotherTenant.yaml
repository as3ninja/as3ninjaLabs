      remark: self-signed RSA certificate fetched from HashiCorp vault by as3ninja
      # instead of using YAML merge we use as3ninja to fetch the secret from HashiCorp vault
      #
      # as3ninja will load the composed yaml as a "configuration" and store it in
      # it's 'ninja.' namespace.
      #
      # therefore the secrets defined in secrets.yaml are accessible by their keys
      # "ninja.secrets.AnotherTenant.AnotherApp1.certificate" therefore refers to the
      # content of secrets.yaml:      \
      # secrets:                       \
